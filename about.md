This website is dedicated to the book: **Rethinking IT Security: What needs to be said. How can we solve the IT security problem long term?**

This book tries to provide provocative new ways of looking at IT security and how we can realistically solve the lack of IT security long term. It is frequently said that people have a problem seeing the trees from the forest, but this book inverts the saying and implies that it seems to be hard for people to see the forest from the trees. Implying, that people have been looking for solutions addressing IT security within their own companies or environments, instead of thinking of ways to address and solve it on a large scale.

You can buy a copy of my book on Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Security-needs-security-problem/dp/1546410988/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496676466&sr=8-1&keywords=rethinking+it+security">![RethinkingITSecurity]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/amazon.png){:width="100px"}</a>
