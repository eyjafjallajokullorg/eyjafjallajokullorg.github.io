It was a pleasure to participate and give a talk at the <a href="https://bsidesbelfast.org/">BSidesBelfast</a> conference for the second time. It is the biggest IT security conference held in Northern Ireland. Last year's conference was well attended, but this year even more people attended. Speakers at the conference included people from Cisco - Talos, Kaspersky Lab, NCC Group and AlienVault. 

This is the first time I give a talk on my recently published book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Security-needs-security-problem/dp/1546410988">Rethinking IT Security</a>. I got a lot of good feedback, good questions and people were happy with my talk :-)

This time I didn't have time to look around in Belfast as much as I would have liked since I was mostly working. Here are a few photos I took from the event.

It was nice to be able to relax for one evening and grab some quiet drinks with <a href="https://twitter.com/r00tbsd">@r00tbsd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MitchNeff">@MitchNeff</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/x0rz">@x0rz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs">@juanandres_gs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityBeard">@SecurityBeard</a> and a couple of other good folks.
