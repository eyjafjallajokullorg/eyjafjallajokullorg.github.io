I really enjoyed attending and presenting at the monthly OWASP LA meetup. Richard Greenberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/ragreenberg">@RAGreenberg</a> and Edmond Momartin are doing a great job organizing the OWASP events in LA. 
 
 <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Los-Angeles/events/248346073/"> ![talkdescription]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/owaspLA/owaspLA_event.png) </a>,

 This event was very professionally organized. The event was hosted by "Cornerstone On Demand".

There were two other people also presenting at the meetup: Ira Winkler (<a href="https://twitter.com/irawinkler">@irawinkler</a> and Tracy Celaya (<a href="https://twitter.com/_tracycelaya">@_tracycelaya</a>).  I enjoyed meeting Ira Winkler again, even though we didn't have much time to chat. I hadn't seen him since we were both presenting at Hacker Halted Europe back in 2013. Time flies by so fast ...  

The offices of Cornerstone are located in a beautiful location in Santa Monica. They have a very modern environment, with an awesome game room. It looks like a really nice place to work at. As far as I know they are still looking for more security engineers, so if you live in the area (or are interested in living in the area), I recommend reaching out to them :-)

As usual I hardly took any pictures at the event myself (a part from a couple I took near the end). The photos I'm including in this blog post are those from the meetup event itself.

While traveling in California I did find time to enjoy some of what's available. Hanging out by the beach, going to various restaurants, attending some shows. Most notably I enjoyed going to the <a href="https://www.goldsgym.com/veniceca/">The Mecca of Bodybuilding" - Gold's gym</a>, where I was able to train with the legendary Charles Glass <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecharlesglass">(@thecharlesglass)</a> for a couple of days. Here are a few photos from my trip.
